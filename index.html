    <!--When the browser sees script without defer
    1) Pauses HTML parsing right there
    2) Downloads script.js
    3) Runs it inmediately
    4) continues parsing the rest of the HTML
    
    In my Js code I am selecting the start-timer, so it 
    would not exist. And that's why I user defer. With defer:

    1) I start downloading the script in parallel with the HTML
    2) Keep parsing the rest of the HTML without parsing
    3) Executes the script after the whole HTML is parsed

    With defer, the DOM is ready when your JS runs, and document.querySelector works without wrapping your code in DOMContentLoaded
